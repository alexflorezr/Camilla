# Null model analysis based on neutral assembly #

Community ecologists rely extensively on the use of null models for hypothesis testing. In most cases, these null models are generated by randomising data tables and are not based on any mechanistic hypothesis. This repository contains R code that facilitates the generation of null models based on Hubbell's Neutral Model of Biodiverisity and Biogeography.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains R code for: 

1) generating gp input files to estimate neutral model parameters and to simulate communities assembling under neutrality, using the sampling formulae and associated gp code published by Etienne in 2007 (doi: 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01052.x) and 2009 (doi: 10.1890/08-0750.1);

2) reading gp output containing parameter estimates and simulated communities; and

3) estimating and visualising effect sizes between observed and simulated communities.
